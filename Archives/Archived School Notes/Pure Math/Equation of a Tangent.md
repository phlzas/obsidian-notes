**Equation of a Tangent Line**  

---

### Formula:  
For a function $y = f(x)$, the tangent line at $x = a$ is:  
$$
y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)
$$  

---

### Example:  
**Function:** $y = x^2$ at $x = 2$  

1. **Find $f(2)$:**  
   $$
   f(2) = 2^2 = 4
   $$  

2. **Differentiate:**  
   $$
   f'(x) = 2x \Rightarrow f'(2) = 4
   $$  

3. **Substitute into formula:**  
   $$
   y - 4 = 4(x - 2)
   $$  
   $$
   \Rightarrow y = 4x - 4
   $$  

**Result:**  
$$
\boxed{y = 4x - 4}
$$

### Tip:  
Tangent line touches the curve at one point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.
