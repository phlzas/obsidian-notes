➢ Electrostatic induction happens when a charged object gets close to a neutral
object. The charged object creates an electric field around it. This electric
field affects the charges in the neutral object, causing them to redistribute.
As a result, one side of the neutral object becomes more positive while the
other side becomes more negative.

➢ This happens because the charges in the neutral object are attracted or
repelled by the charged object's electric field. However, there is no physical
contact between the two objects.
