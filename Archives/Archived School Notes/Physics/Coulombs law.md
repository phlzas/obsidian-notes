==Electrostatic forces== are produced from relationship known as ==Coulombs law== and descried by using the concept of the [[Electric filed]] 

### **Coulomb found that …**
the force between the two charged spheres A and B depended on the distance.
He showed that

## Seeing from figure A and B we can understand that..
that means two attributes that change that can effect the force which are
- the force (F) inversely with the distance square between the centers of the spheres.
$$
 𝐹 ∝ 1/ d² 
$$

- the force (F) directly with the charge of the bodies.
$$
𝐹 ∝ 𝑞₁  𝑞₂
$$
# So what is Coulomb law?
it's a law that gives you the force of attraction between two point charges theses forces have to be equal in magnitude int but opposite in direction to use this law
(If two point charges q₁ and q₂ are separated by a distance d then the magnitude of
the force of repulsion or attraction between them) is

$$
  
{\displaystyle |F|=k_{\text{e}}{\frac {|q_{1}||q_{2}|}{r^{2}}}}
$$
Here, $k_e$ is a constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the quantities of each charge, and the scalar $_r$ is the distance between the charges.

The force is along the straight line joining the two charges. If the charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them makes them repel; if they have different signs, the force between them makes them attract.
