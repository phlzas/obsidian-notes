An **electric field** in physics is a vector field that describes the electric force per unit charge exerted on a test charge at rest at any given point in space. It is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism and is crucial for understanding how electric charges interact with each other.

## Key Aspects of Electric Fields

- **Definition**: An electric field is defined as the force per unit charge, mathematically expressed a $E = \frac{F}{q} = \frac{kq}{d^2}$, where $E$ is the electric field strength, $F$ is the electric force, and $q$ is the charge [1,](https://byjus.com/jee/electric-field/)[2,](https://study.com/academy/lesson/electric-fields-definition-examples-quiz.html)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field) 
OR
- The electric field is defined as (the area around a charge in which the effect of that charge can be felt)
OR
-  The electric field is the magnitude of the electric force at any given point in space
    
- **Units**: The SI units of electric field strength are newtons per coulomb (N/C) or volts per meter (V/m), which are equivalent [3,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field)[4](https://www.britannica.com/science/electric-field).
    
- **Interaction**: Electric fields cause forces between charges. Opposite charges attract, while like charges repel, following Coulomb's law [2,](https://study.com/academy/lesson/electric-fields-definition-examples-quiz.html)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field).

either generated surrounding an electric charge or by varying a magnetic field with respect to time.
### There for
- A stationary positive charge has electric field lines pointing outwards
- while a stationary negative charge has electric field lines pointing  inwards.
