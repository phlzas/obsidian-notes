# Two-Pointer Technique

## Core Patterns
[[sliding-window]] 
- Fixed vs variable size
- Window maintenance cost

[[collision-pointers]]
- Palindrome verification
- Container with most water

[[parallel-pointers]]
- Merging sorted arrays
- Interval intersections

## Complexity Analysis
- O(n) time complexity average case
- O(1) space advantage

## Real-World Uses
➜ Stock price analysis systems  
➜ DNA sequence alignment tools
