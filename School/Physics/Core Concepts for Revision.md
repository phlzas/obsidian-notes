## Capacitors  
**Definition**:  
- A [[Capacitor]] consists of two parallel plates separated by a [[Dielectric]].  
- **Formula**: $$C = \frac{Q}{V}$$  
  - $C$: [[Capacitance]] (unit: [[Farad (F)]])  
  - $Q$: Charge stored  
  - $V$: Voltage across plates  

### DC Circuit Behavior  
- Momentary current during charging; no current at steady state.  

#### Series Connection  
- Same charge: $Q = Q_1 = Q_2 = \dots$  
- Voltage splits: $V_t = V_1 + V_2 + \dots$  
- Equivalent capacitance: $$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \dots$$  

#### Parallel Connection  
- Same voltage: $V_t = V_1 = V_2 = \dots$  
- Charge splits: $Q_t = Q_1 + Q_2 + \dots$  
- Equivalent capacitance: $$C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + \dots$$

## Dynamic Electricity Basics  
### Material Types  
- [[Conductors]] (e.g., copper): Allow easy charge flow due to free electrons.  
- [[Insulators]] (e.g., plastic): Resist charge flow.  
- [[Semiconductors]] (e.g., silicon): Intermediate conductivity.  

### Key Quantities  
1. **Electric Current ($I$)**:  
   - Flow of charge per second: $$I = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{Ne}{t}$$  
   - Unit: [[Ampere (A)]] = $C/s$.  
   - Direction: [[Conventional Current]] (+ to -) vs. [[Electron Flow]] (- to +).  

2. **Potential Difference ($V$)**:  
   - Work done per charge: $$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$  
   - Unit: [[Volt (V)]] = $J/C$.  

3. **Resistance ($R$)**:  
   - Opposition to current: $$R = \frac{V}{I}$$  
   - Unit: [[Ohm (Ω)]].

## Ohm’s Law  
- **Statement**: $V = IR$ at constant temperature.  
- **Graph**: Linear (Ohmic materials) vs. non-linear.  
- **Resistivity ($\rho$)**:  
  - Formula: $$R = \rho \cdot \frac{l}{A}$$  
  - $\rho$: Material property (unit: $\Omega \cdot m$).  
  - Related: [[Conductivity]] ($\sigma = 1/\rho$).

## Electric Power  
- **Definition**: Rate of energy consumption.  
- **Formulas**:  
  $$P = VI$$  
  $$P = I^2R$$  
  $$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$  
- Unit: [[Watt (W)]] = $J/s = V \cdot A$.

**Key Variables to Remember**:  
- $\rho$ ([[Resistivity]]), $\sigma$ ([[Conductivity]]), $e$ (electron charge: $1.6 \times 10^{-19} C$).
