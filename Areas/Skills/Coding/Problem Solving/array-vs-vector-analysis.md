# Array vs Vector Analysis

## Key Components

[[memory-layout-comparison]]

- Contiguous allocation patterns
- Stack vs heap behavior

[[operation-complexity]]

- Random access: O(1) both
- Insertion: O(n) vs amortized O(1)

## Real-World Applications

âžœ High-frequency trading systems (arrays)  
âžœ Game engine development (vectors)

## Monetization Paths
