## Key Concepts  
### Definition  
- **Current Intensity ($I$)**: The rate at which electric charges flow through a conductor’s cross-section.  
- **Physical Meaning**: Measures the amount of charge ($Q$) passing a point in a conductor per unit time ($t$).  

### Formula  
$$I = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{N e}{t}$$  
- $I$: Current intensity (Amperes, A).  
- $Q$: Total charge (Coulombs, C).  
- $t$: Time (seconds, s).  
- $N$: Number of electrons passing the point.  
- $e$: Charge of an electron ($1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}$).  

### Units and Measurement  
- **Unit**: Ampere (A) = 1 Coulomb per second (C/s).  
  - **Definition of Ampere**: Current intensity is 1 A if 1 C of charge passes through a conductor’s cross-section in 1 second.  
- **Instrument**: Measured using an **ammeter**, connected in series in a circuit.  

### Direction of Current  
- **Conventional Current**: Assumes positive charges flow from the positive to the negative terminal.  
- **Electron Flow**: Actual movement of electrons from negative to positive, opposite to conventional current.  

### Role in Circuits  
- Current intensity is a fundamental quantity in [[Dynamic Electricity]].  
- Relates to voltage and resistance via [[Ohm's Law]]:  
  $$V = I R$$  
- Used to calculate electric power:  
  $$P = V I$$

## Example Calculation  
- **Problem**: A conductor carries 12 C of charge in 4 s. Calculate the current intensity.  
- **Solution**:  
  $$I = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\ \text{A}$$

**Practice Questions**:  
1. Calculate the current intensity if 20 C of charge flows through a wire in 5 s.  
2. How many electrons pass through a conductor in 1 s if the current intensity is 2 A?  
3. Explain the difference between conventional current and electron flow.
