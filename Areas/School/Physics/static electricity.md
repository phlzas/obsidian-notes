## Fundamental Principle

$$F = k_e \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$$  
Where:

- $k_e = 8.987×10^9\ \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$ (Coulomb's constant)
- $q$ = Charge in coulombs
- $r$ = Separation distance

## Example 1: Charged Spheres Interaction

### Context

Two 1μC charges separated by 10cm in air

### Calculation Process

1. Convert units:  
   $q_1 = q_2 = 1×10^{-6}\ \text{C}$  
   $r = 0.1\ \text{m}$
2. Apply Coulomb's Law:  
   $$F = 8.987×10^9 \frac{(1×10^{-6})(1×10^{-6})}{(0.1)^2}$$
3. Calculate:  
   $$F = 8.987×10^9 × \frac{1×10^{-12}}{0.01} = 0.8987\ \text{N}$$  
   $$\boxed{0.9\ \text{N}\ \text{(repulsive)}}$$

## Key Takeaways

- Inverse-square relationship: Doubling distance ⇒ ¼ force
- Charge polarity determines attraction/repulsion
- Common Errors:
  1. Forgetting to convert μC to C
  2. Misapplying signs in force direction
  3. Ignoring medium's permittivity

### How does static electricity happen?

This occurs when electrons are transferred from one object to another, often through friction, such as rubbing a balloon against your hair. The object gaining electrons becomes negatively charged, while the one losing them becomes positively charged. Since these charges do not move freely, they are referred to as "static." When the charge eventually discharges, such as by touching a metal surface, it can create a small shock, a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXnRzv8up9U) to explain further.

### What is electric charge?

1. Electric charge is a physical quantity that can be transferred
   from one object to another.
2. Charged objects can exert forces on other charged objects and
   also on uncharged objects.
3. Finally, the electric charge classified into two types:
   - positive charge
   - negative charge

### is there a surface where charges can't move on it freely and is the opposite true?

YES, ==**insulators**== they are material's in which electric charge is not easily transferred and there are ==**conductors**== where it can transfer very easily

### Coulomb's law.

### Dangers of static electricity:

1. ==Lightning== is static electricity due to charges in clouds, and it can damage buildings and harm people.
2. Static electricity can damage ==sensitive electrical components==, such as the parts inside computers. To prevent this, these parts are handled with anti-static bags and wrist straps, which drain the static charge off the person.
3. Static electricity can be responsible for ==the ignition of flammable gases==, such as the vapors produced by petrol (gasoline) when you are filling your car at the petrol- station.
4. ==Dusts and germs are attracted by charged objects== and so it is essential to ensure that equipment and medical personal are well earthed allowing electrons to flow to and from the ground e.g. by conducting rubber.

### Some uses for static electricity:

1. Static electricity is used to paint cars. Special powder paints that have been charged positively spread out to form a very even coating of paint on an earthed metal body of a car.

2. It is used in computer printers to distribute toner or ink to go at the right place.

3. Static electricity is also used to remove pollution from smoke-chimneys. Electrostatic plates are placed in the chimneys of the factories that attract all the polluted dust.
