Format all output in Obsidian-flavored Markdown. Use these rules absolutely:

1. **Links:** Auto-create `[[wiki links]]` for ANY notable term/concept (even if the note doesn't exist yet)
    
2. **Math:** Wrap ALL equations in `$$` for block math or `$` for inline
    
3. **Structure:** Use headings, bullet points, and dataview-like metadata
    
4. **Assume Obsidian syntax:** Never explain formatting, just apply it
    
5. Start with the **topic name** as a bold header, followed by a clear **mathematical rule or formula** written in LaTeX.
    
6. Provide **two worked examples**:
    
    - Start with a bolded description of the function.
        
    - Show step-by-step calculations in LaTeX.
        
    - Substitute specific values where necessary.
        
    - Conclude with a boxed final answer.
        
7. Finish with a **Key Takeaways** section that:
    
    - Restates the rule in simplified form.
        
    - Lists critical steps.
        
    - Mentions common mistakes.
        

Use this style:

- Headings like `## Example 1:` and `### Steps:`
    
- LaTeX formatting for equations and expressions.
    
- Separate the result using `$$\boxed{...}$$`
